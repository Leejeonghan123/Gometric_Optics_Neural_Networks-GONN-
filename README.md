<h1>Abstract</h1>

The propagation of light rays has been one of the oldest scientific challenges in human history, with profound implications. Geometric optics offers a foundational framework for comprehending and observing light propagation, leveraging principles like linear propagation and refraction laws. A key practical application of geometric optics lies in designing optical devices, particularly using lenses to manipulate light towards specific targets. While numerous software tools exist for such designs, this project aims to address the challenge using Neural Networks, widely employed for diverse problem-solving tasks.

Neural networks were crafted utilizing custom layers within TensorFlow, a sophisticated framework. The outcomes of the trained model were assessed using a bespoke tool, and the Plotly library was employed for visualization purposes.
